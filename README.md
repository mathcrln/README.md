## 💡 What I'm doing now
As of 2024, I'm actively learning and improving my skills in web development and web design. I currently focus on :

- Leveraging React, mostly Next.js + Tailwind, PlanetScale Data and Prisma,
- Developing my UX/UI Knowledge, as well as in SEO, Accessibility and Product Management, 
- Making my code cleaner, more readable and reusable,
- Building my own homelab setup and playing with Docker, Proxmox and VPN stuff, 
- Diving into Obsidian and learning how to learn in public,
- Investigating the mysteries of the universe 🔭
